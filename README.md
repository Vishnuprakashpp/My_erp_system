The ERP system's interface is designed to streamline business operations efficiently, catering to key functionalities through its various pages. The Dashboard serves as a centralized hub, offering a succinct overview of critical metrics and features essential for managing the business effectively. Users can swiftly navigate to the Products Management and Orders Management pages from the Dashboard, facilitating seamless access to essential tasks. Within the Products Management section, administrators can manipulate product listings effortlessly, including functionalities to add, edit, and delete products. Similarly, the Orders Management page provides comprehensive insights into orders, displaying crucial details such as order ID, customer name, order date, and status, thereby streamlining order handling processes. As an optional feature, the system offers an Orders Calendar View, allowing users to visualize orders based on their expected delivery dates. Users can interact with the calendar to view orders due for delivery on specific dates, enhancing scheduling and planning capabilities. The frontend of the application is built using React, ensuring modular components, efficient state management, and seamless navigation through React Router. Responsive design principles have been incorporated to ensure optimal user experience across various devices. Detailed documentation, including a comprehensive README file, provides clear instructions for setting up and interacting with the website, supplemented by illustrative screenshots demonstrating the application's functionality
